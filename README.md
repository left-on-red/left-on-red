### hi there, my name is red;

I make stuff when I'm bored.

#### raw skills
- Javascript/TypeScript
- Node.js
- HTML/CSS/SCSS
- C# (.NET)
- cursory Java & Python experience
- Git workflow
- high-level understanding of low-level concepts (I may be a JS dev but I know what memory management is!)

#### familiar libraries/frameworks
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)

#### Some notable projects that I've done in the past include:
- A small demo of a [Pokemon Battle Simulator](https://github.com/shadeRed/pokemonBattleSimulator) written in Java that I made for my Software Architecture Final.
- A [Professional Application](https://github.com/shadeRed/wcd-portfolio) that I was commissioned by WCD (Wisconsin Center District) to write.

***I'm currently working on***
- A Discord Bot named [Charisma](https://github.com/shadeRed/charisma) using a Discord Bot engine that I've been developing.
- I've been experimenting with Node.js and handling raw binary data with it. One such example was taking a Pokemon Emerald ROM file and analyzing the binary structure and extracting certain information from it. (Not currently on my GitHub Profile)
- A Vue.js [Application](https://github.com/shadeRed/crypto-app) that's designed to help you track your individual Crypto Currency investments and help you know when would be the best time to buy or sell certain Crypto Coins.
- An [Item Tracker](https://github.com/shadeRed/ootr-item-tracker) for the game [The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time) that's intended to be used in conjunction with a [Randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com/) for the game to aid in keeping track of your progress throughout the duration of the playthrough.

***I'm trying to learn***
- more about the low-level architecture of certain file formats. I want to get a better understanding of how certain binary data is typically organized so I can apply that knowledge to modifying retro game ROM files and other related types of data.

The easiest way to contact me is through Discord. my username is *red.bin* (hit me up if you wanna chat)
