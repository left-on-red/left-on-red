### Hi there, my name is red;

I'm a web developer who likes to make stuff when he's bored.

#### Some of my skills include:
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- SCSS (Sass)
- Node.js (backend JS)
- C# (.NET)
- Java
- a little bit of Python
- Git Workflow

#### Some of the libraries that I have experience with are:
- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) (Node.js Discord API)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (CSS framework)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) (websockets)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (Node.js HTTP servers)
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (CSS Icon Library)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (JavaScript Framework)
- [Vuetify](https://vuejs.org/) (Vue Library)

#### Some notable projects that I've done in the past include:
- A small demo of a [Pokemon Battle Simulator](https://github.com/shadeRed/pokemonBattleSimulator) written in Java that I made for my Software Architecture Final.
- A [Professional Application](https://github.com/shadeRed/wcd-portfolio) that I was commissioned by WCD (Wisconsin Center District) to write.

***I'm currently working on***
- A Discord Bot named [Charisma](https://github.com/shadeRed/charisma) using a Discord Bot engine that I've been developing.
- I've been experimenting with Node.js and handling raw binary data with it. One such example was taking a Pokemon Emerald ROM file and analyzing the binary structure and extracting certain information from it. (Not currently on my GitHub Profile)
- A Vue.js [Application](https://github.com/shadeRed/crypto-app) that's designed to help you track your individual Crypto Currency investments and help you know when would be the best time to buy or sell certain Crypto Coins.
- An [Item Tracker](https://github.com/shadeRed/ootr-item-tracker) for the game [The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time) that's intended to be used in conjunction with a [Randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com/) for the game to aid in keeping track of your progress throughout the duration of the playthrough.

***I'm trying to learn***
- More about [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). I just recently started using it, and now that I have, I've started to completely rethink the process of Web Development.
- More about the low level architecture of certain file formats. I want to get a better understanding about how certain binary data is typically organized so I can apply that knowledge to modifying retro game ROM files and other related types of data.

The easiest way to contact me is through Discord. my username + tag is *red;#0531*

##### I'm 100% down to collaborate with any project pretty much any time. I have pretty good personal skills but I don't have much experience actually working with people. most of my projects I've done completely by myself which can get a little lonely and tedious sometimes. Plus additional experience working with others would be incredibly valuable to me.
