### hi there, my name is red;

I'm a web developer who likes to make stuff when he's bored

#### some of my skills include:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS (Sass)
- Node.js (backend JS)
- C# (.NET)
- a little bit of Python
- I'm learning a little more about git

#### some of the libraries that I have experience with are:
- Discord.js (Node.js Discord API)
- Bootstrap (CSS framework)
- Socket.io (websockets)
- Express (Node.js HTTP servers)

#### some notable projects that I've done in the past include:
- a small demo of a Pokemon Battle Simulator written in Java (was a final project for a class)
- a demo of an "Ultimate" Animal Crossing: New Horizons wiki of sorts called the [Horizons Compendium](https://github.com/shadeRed/horizons-compendium) that I developed to further my understanding of web servers and how they work

***I'm currently working on*** a Discord Bot named Charisma using a Discord Bot engine that I've been developing. she's meant to be an all purpose Discord Bot with many features and she's coming along very nicely! once I get her to a 1.0 release, I plan to continue working on this project that I've named [Sylvir](https://github.com/shadeRed/sylvir)

***I'm trying to learn*** more about how certain web communications work. many of my projects incorperate communication via servers/websites and that whole idea just fascinates me

the easiest way to contact me is through Discord. my username + tag is *red;#2787*

##### I'm 100% down to collaborate with any project pretty much any time. I have pretty good personal skills but I don't have much experience actually working with people. most of my projects I've done completely by myself which can get a little lonely and tedious sometimes
